    \caption{\textbf{Sample behaviour of the preprocessed mRNA expression data.} The mRNA expression data from \textit{M. musculus} liver and brain, that had been \ac{RPM} normalized and log2-transformed, was decomposed using singular value decomposition and the first and second eigengenes were plotted against each other. The samples were coloured by the organ they were sampled from, blue for liver samples and orange for brain samples.}

The z-scores for the mRNA expression values from liver and brain that had been \ac{RPM} normalized and log2-transformed was for each gene calculated and the results were gathered and plotted as a histogram to confirm that they were normally distributed.}
