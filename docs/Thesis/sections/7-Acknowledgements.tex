\vspace{-0.75cm}
I would first of like to thank my supervisor, Lukas Käll, for having offered me this project, for all the help and advice he has given throughout, and for believing in me till the end. A huge thank you is also owed to my co-supervisor Gustavo Jeuken for all his help and kindness. 

I am also grateful for the expert input on transcription factors received from by Marcel Tarbier, the gene expression data provided by Claudia Kutter's lab at SciLifeLab, as well as for all the friendly advice and input I have received from Partik Bjärterot, who performed his master project supervised by Lukas Käll during the same time period. Thank you all.
